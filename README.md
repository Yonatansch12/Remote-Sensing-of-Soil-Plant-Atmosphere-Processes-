## Remote-Sensing-of-Soil-Plant-Atmosphere-Processes-
Final Project on Remote Sensing of Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Processes 

The project is in the PDF file with a link to Python code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The given instructions for the final project SPAP:

Make sure you understand the class explanations on generating a height
your assignment is to prepare and present the following:
1) A figure with panels of 1km spatial resolution maps of H, LE, G, Rn, and ET (in mm d-1) for an AOI that you will choose in Israel for two dates (22/3/2018 and 24/8/2018, at 13:00). Each date should be presented as a separate panel. Each + should include its legend and color bar, showing the range of flux values. Maps should be generated using Cartopy with shorelines, water bodies (if present), and grids [Notice that points will be reduced for a clumsy presentation of these maps].
2) Calculate the mean, median, and range of the fluxes in your AOI on both dates and compare. What can you say about your results?
3) Generate a scatterplot of the different fluxes per date and between dates (with full statistics). Think of other original ways to analyze your results...
4) Explain and discuss the above results thoroughly [This is where we reward you for your original contribution...]
Work should be submitted with your full name as a Python Notebook with Titles and explanations as markdown texts. Don't forget the evaluation criteria (slide #10 in the first PPT)
Comments:
The AOI should be 50x50 km and overlap the WRF files' area. 
Student must choose their own AOI. 
Name your shapefile 'AOI_Israel_Your_Surname.shp' and send it to us for approval (don't start working before we approve your AOI). Then, upload it as a Zip folder.
Ensure you understand the class explanations about calculating the wind speed from the u and v vectors map from an LC map.
Good luck
